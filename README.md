Programme for International Students Assessment (PISA) measures 15-year-oldsâ€™ ability to use their reading, mathematics and science knowledge and skills to meet real-life challenges. Also, PISA measures different concept (Well-being, educational careers, ICT familiarities, financial literacy) with questionnaires. 
In this study, I focused ICT familiarities topic.  

PISA 2018 assessed students' science, reading, and mathematics literacy in about 80 countries and education systems. Reading was the focal subject of the 2018 data collection, as it was in 2009. PISA 2018 also included the optional assessment of financial literacy which the United States administered. Data from the core 2018 reading, mathematics, science literacy, and financial literacy assessment are now available.
